Key Outcomes

✅ Operational Efficiency
	•	Automated config updates, restarts, and DB password rotations → 80+ engineer-hours saved per quarter.
	•	Reduced manual refresh validation effort by 70%.

✅ Improved Reliability & Resilience
	•	Enhanced monitoring dashboards (JVM topology, cert expiry, license usage, DB queries, SLA metrics).
	•	40% MTTR reduction via proactive Datadog/AppDynamics monitoring.
	•	Eliminated legacy scripts by consolidating into Datadog workflows.

✅ Compliance & Security
	•	Automated permissions scans, world-writable checks, CA imports, cert renewals.
	•	Ensured environments passed security audits with minimal escalations.

✅ Innovation & Growth
	•	Introduced BNPF portal, reducing analysis/reporting from days → minutes.
	•	PoC for Flyway DB versioning and ML anomaly detection.
	•	Completed 2 Datadog certifications (2025) and 3 AWS certifications (2024).

⸻

Impact Metrics
	•	5+ major platform initiatives supported to successful go-live.
	•	Zero major incidents in production releases supported.
	•	~400+ hours saved annually from automation.
	•	Improved compliance posture across all preprod/prod regions.

⸻

Future Roadmap (2026)
	•	Expand configuration-as-code across all Finacle regions.
	•	Leverage AI/ML for predictive monitoring.
	•	Standardize Finacle CICD pipeline (APDMAS MVP).
	•	Build cloud migration readiness (AWS/Datadog/AAP).
