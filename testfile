This chart uses two Y-axes, which is perfect for plotting two different units of measurement (like seconds and percent) against the same time axis.

X-Axis (Horizontal): Time (The month/year of the batch run).

Example Labels: Jan 2024, Feb 2024, Mar 2024, etc.

Left Y-Axis: Metrics in their native units (Seconds for Total Time, Records/Second for Throughput).

This axis will have two line series:

Baseline Total Time (a flat, horizontal line)

Actual Total Time (a line that goes up and down)

And/or two more line series:
3. Baseline Throughput (a flat, horizontal line)
4. Actual Throughput (a line that goes up and down)

Right Y-Axis: Deviation Percentage (%).

This axis will have one or two line series:

Throughput Deviation % ((Current - Baseline) / Baseline * 100)

(Optional) Total Time Deviation %
